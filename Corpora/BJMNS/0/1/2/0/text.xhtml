<p style="margin: 0">Exasperated Wolf is in the cavity of a
tree where the tree had rotted away. Birds had lived there, but
they had migrated to another area. Exasperated Wolf saw some
sheep. Sheep are not poisoned, but are edible. They are also
nourishing and good for you. He walked to a remote and not
occupied house’s foundation, or base. Close by, a boy is giving
some adults some trouble. Will Exasperated Wolf get his sheep
because the adults are too discouraged by the boy to attack? Or
will Exasperated Wolf be caught red-handed?</p>
