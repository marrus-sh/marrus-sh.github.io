<html:p>To take an analogy from the world of the computer’s second cousins, the video games: it is almost impossible to learn to play a video game if you try to understand first and play second. 
	Girls are often perceived as preferring the ‘easier’ video games. 
	When I have looked more closely at what they really prefer, it is games where they can understand ‘the rules’ before play begins. 
	Both Lisa and Robin crave transparent understanding of the computer. 
	For example, although both apologize for their behavior as ‘silly,’ both like to program the computer to do everything they need to build their larger programs, even when these smaller, ‘building-block’ procedures are in program libraries at their disposal. 
	It makes their job harder, but both say that it gives them a more satisfying understanding. 
	They don’t like taking risks at the machine. 
	What they most want to avoid is error messages.</html:p>

<html:p>First, insisting that the computer is just a tool is a defense against the experience of the computer as the opposite, as an intimate machine.

	Computers with their plasticity and malleability are compelling media. 
	They have a psychological ‘holding power.’ 
	Women use their rejection of computer holding power to assert something about themselves as women.

	It may shut people out, temporarily, but the work itself can bring one closer to oneself, and ultimately to others. 
	In the right settings, people develop relationships with computers that feel artistic and personal. 
	And yet, for most people, and certainly for the women I studied, this was rare. 
	When they began to approach the computer in their own style, they got their wrists slapped, and were told that they were not doing things ‘right.’</html:p>

		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>This history makes its mark on what, individually, we are and do. 
	One set of effects turns up in the irreducible multilayeredness and multiphasedness of what queer survival means—since being a survivor on this scene is a matter of surviving <html:em>into</html:em> threat, stigma, the spiraling violence of gay‐ and lesbian‐bashing, and (in the AIDS emergency) the omnipresence of somatic fear and wrenching loss. 
	It is also to have survived into a moment of unprecedented cultural richness, cohesion, and assertiveness for many lesbian and gay adults. 
	Survivors’ guilt, survivors’ glee, even survivors’ responsibility: powerfully as these are experienced, they are also more than complicated by how permeable the identity “survivor” must be to the undiminishing currents of risk, illness, mourning, and defiance.</html:p>

		<schema.org:isBasedOn rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/resources/works/2049719"/>
		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>I think many adults (and I am among them) are trying, in our work, to keep faith with vividly remembered promises made to ourselves in childhood: promises to make invisible possibilities and desires visible; to make the tacit things explicit; to smuggle queer representation in where it must be smuggled and, with the relative freedom of adulthood, to challenge queer‐eradicating impulses frontally where they are to be so challenged.</html:p>
<html:p>I think that for many of us in childhood the ability to attach intently to a few cultural objects, objects of high or popular culture or both, objects whose meaning seemed mysterious, excessive, or oblique in relation to the codes most readily available to us, became a prime resource for survival. 
	We needed for there to be sites where the meanings didn’t line up tidily with each other, and we learned to invest those sites with fascination and love. 
	This can’t help coloring the adult relation to cultural texts and objects; in fact, it’s almost hard for me to imagine another way of coming to care enough about literature to give a lifetime to it.</html:p>

		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>For me, this strong formalist investment didn’t imply (as formalism is generally taken to imply) an evacuation of interest from the passional, the imagistic, the ethical dimensions of the texts, but quite the contrary: the need I brought to books and poems was hardly to be circumscribed, and I felt I knew I would have to struggle to wrest from them sustaining news of the world, ideas, myself, and (in various senses) my kind. 
	The reading practice founded on such basic demands and intuitions had necessarily to run against the grain of the most patent available formulae for young people’s reading and life—against the grain, often, of the most accessible voices even in the texts themselves. 
	At any rate, becoming a perverse reader was never a matter of my condescension to texts, rather of the surplus charge of my trust in them to remain powerful, refractory, and exemplary. 
	And this doesn’t seem an unusual way for ardent reading to function in relation to queer experience.</html:p>

		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>A thousand things make it impossible to mistake the verdict on queer lives and on women’s lives, as on the lives of those who are poor or are not white. 
	The hecatombs of queer youth; a decade squandered in a killing inaction on AIDS; the rapacious seizure from women of our defense against forced childbirth; tens of millions of adults and children excluded from the health care economy; treatment of homeless people as unsanitary refuse to be dealt with by periodic “sweeps”; refusal of condoms in prisons, persecution of needle exchange programs; denial and trivialization of histories of racism; or merely the pivot of a disavowing pronoun in a newspaper editorial: such things as these are facts, but at the same time they are piercing or murmuring voices in the heads of those of us struggling to marshal “our” resources against illness, dread, and devaluation. 
	They speak to us.

		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>Rightists today like to invoke the threatening specter of a propaganda‐ridden socialist realism, but both they and the anti‐intellectuals of the left might meditate on why the Nazis’ campaign against “degenerate art” (Jewish, gay, modernist) was couched, as their own arguments are, in terms of assuring the instant, unmediated, and universal accessibility of all the sign systems of art (Goebbels even banning all art criticism in 1936, on the grounds that art is self‐explanatory). 
	It’s hard to tell which assumption is more insultingly wrong: that the People (always considered, of course, as a monolithic unit) have no need and no faculty for engaging with work that is untransparent; or that the work most genuinely expressive of the People would be so univocal and so limpidly vacant as quite to obviate the labors and pleasures of interpretation.</html:p>

<html:p>You have gathered already that the Calamity is the result of apocalypse deferred by generations that could not deal with it in their own time. 
	My generation is guilty of the same. 
	But that does not make you more responsible for the world; it only means that you are the last ones who have a chance. 
	Our failures weigh on you, but that does not change who you are. 
	All of you who are preparing to fight, all of you who <html:em>have</html:em> fought—you and the princess and the Zora prince and the Chief of the Gerudo and all the others—are still children. 
	You are still growing. 
	When you stop this end, when you keep the world from breaking, you will continue to grow.</html:p>

<html:p>We made a fundamental mistake in understanding what had happened. 
	We fell into the trap of thinking we were so important—that Mark Rudd was the leader of the Columbia strike. 
	It was like we accepted the media image of white people as the protagonists. 
	We saw ourselves as that important.</html:p>
<html:p>But another big mistake that I was directly responsible for was eliminating organizing we had done so much of and substituting it with militancy. 
	The last few months of Columbia <html:abbr title="Students for a Democratic Society">SDS</html:abbr>, a new faction that I led, the Action Faction, took over the chapter from the Praxis Axis, who were the old red diaper babies who taught us to build the base. 
	But we said, “No, it’s action that’s important.”</html:p>
<html:p>We forgot that it took years to get people to the point where they would join SDS.

	He shows that over time, the experience at Columbia and Weathermen was a good example of substituting the media as our base for our original base.
