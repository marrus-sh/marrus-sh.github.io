<html:p>This history makes its mark on what, individually, we are and do. 
	One set of effects turns up in the irreducible multilayeredness and multiphasedness of what queer survival means—since being a survivor on this scene is a matter of surviving <html:em>into</html:em> threat, stigma, the spiraling violence of gay‐ and lesbian‐bashing, and (in the AIDS emergency) the omnipresence of somatic fear and wrenching loss. 
	It is also to have survived into a moment of unprecedented cultural richness, cohesion, and assertiveness for many lesbian and gay adults. 
	Survivors’ guilt, survivors’ glee, even survivors’ responsibility: powerfully as these are experienced, they are also more than complicated by how permeable the identity “survivor” must be to the undiminishing currents of risk, illness, mourning, and defiance.</html:p>

	<schema.org:Quotation rdf:about="?/Tendencies/vividly_remembered_promises">
		<schema.org:isBasedOn rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/resources/works/2049719"/>
		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>I think many adults (and I am among them) are trying, in our work, to keep faith with vividly remembered promises made to ourselves in childhood: promises to make invisible possibilities and desires visible; to make the tacit things explicit; to smuggle queer representation in where it must be smuggled and, with the relative freedom of adulthood, to challenge queer‐eradicating impulses frontally where they are to be so challenged. 
	I think that for many of us in childhood the ability to attach intently to a few cultural objects, objects of high or popular culture or both, objects whose meaning seemed mysterious, excessive, or oblique in relation to the codes most readily available to us, became a prime resource for survival. 
	We needed for there to be sites where the meanings didn’t line up tidily with each other, and we learned to invest those sites with fascination and love. 
	This can’t help coloring the adult relation to cultural texts and objects; in fact, it’s almost hard for me to imagine another way of coming to care enough about literature to give a lifetime to it.</html:p>

	<schema.org:Quotation rdf:about="?/Tendencies/strong_formalist_investment">
		<schema.org:isBasedOn rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/resources/works/2049719"/>
		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>For me, this strong formalist investment didn’t imply (as formalism is generally taken to imply) an evacuation of interest from the passional, the imagistic, the ethical dimensions of the texts, but quite the contrary: the need I brought to books and poems was hardly to be circumscribed, and I felt I knew I would have to struggle to wrest from them sustaining news of the world, ideas, myself, and (in various senses) my kind. 
	The reading practice founded on such basic demands and intuitions had necessarily to run against the grain of the most patent available formulae for young people’s reading and life—against the grain, often, of the most accessible voices even in the texts themselves. 
	At any rate, becoming a perverse reader was never a matter of my condescension to texts, rather of the surplus charge of my trust in them to remain powerful, refractory, and exemplary. 
	And this doesn’t seem an unusual way for ardent reading to function in relation to queer experience.</html:p>

		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>A thousand things make it impossible to mistake the verdict on queer lives and on women’s lives, as on the lives of those who are poor or are not white. 
	The hecatombs of queer youth; a decade squandered in a killing inaction on AIDS; the rapacious seizure from women of our defense against forced childbirth; tens of millions of adults and children excluded from the health care economy; treatment of homeless people as unsanitary refuse to be dealt with by periodic “sweeps”; refusal of condoms in prisons, persecution of needle exchange programs; denial and trivialization of histories of racism; or merely the pivot of a disavowing pronoun in a newspaper editorial: such things as these are facts, but at the same time they are piercing or murmuring voices in the heads of those of us struggling to marshal “our” resources against illness, dread, and devaluation. 
	They speak to us.
	They have an amazing clarity.</html:p>

		<schema.org:isBasedOn rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/resources/works/2049719"/>
		<rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">
<html:p>Rightists today like to invoke the threatening specter of a propaganda‐ridden socialist realism, but both they and the anti‐intellectuals of the left might meditate on why the Nazis’ campaign against “degenerate art” (Jewish, gay, modernist) was couched, as their own arguments are, in terms of assuring the instant, unmediated, and universal accessibility of all the sign systems of art (Goebbels even banning all art criticism in 1936, on the grounds that art is self‐explanatory). 
	It’s hard to tell which assumption is more insultingly wrong: that the People (always considered, of course, as a monolithic unit) have no need and no faculty for engaging with work that is untransparent; or that the work most genuinely expressive of the People would be so univocal and so limpidly vacant as quite to obviate the labors and pleasures of interpretation.</html:p>
