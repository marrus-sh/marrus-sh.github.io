|  + XSD library for Swift (titled Nib), leading up to RDF tools and  |
|    eventually some useful RDF‐related programs for home and office  |
|    (TurtBurgler; Plastromancy; SlashBang and ActivityPub clients).  |
|                                                                     |
|  + RDF library for JavaScript (ｍｅｒｍａｉｄ), which will be used  |
|    to create views on a number of resources (feeds, documents with  |
|    annotations, dictionaries) for reading and browsing in clients.  |
|                                                                     |
