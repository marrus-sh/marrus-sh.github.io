				<h2>Giving people the means to express themselves</h2>
				<p>I am a writer at heart, and I got into web design because <strong>I wanted to publish the stories I wrote as webpages.</strong> But it turns out that knowing HTML is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to creating and distributing resources online. I am interested in building tools for <strong>helping people to (re)present themselves</strong> over the internet, in ways that <strong>stay true to who they are, rather than what some platform thinks they should be.</strong></p>
				<h3>BookGen</h3>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/BookGen"><cite>BookGen</cite></a> is a GNU Makefile for turning Markdown documents into PDF and HTML books. Itʼs the build system that I use for all of my longform writing, and while itʼs a little messy, it gets the job done. Someday Iʼd like to make something which is a little more modular and not written in GNU Make, but thatʼs probably still a good time out.</p>
				<h3>Kico</h3>
				<p>Wiki software abounds, but, surprisingly, software for building encyclopædia­‑like products which <em>arenʼt</em> wikis is pretty hard to come by. <a href="https://github.com/leaf-adventure/Kico/"><cite>Kico: KIBI Codices</cite></a> is a (<abbr title="Work In Progress">WIP</abbr>) RDF­‑based library for building roleplaying codices, worldbuilding bibles, textbook primers, and the like. Itʼs still in its early stages right now, but expect interesting things to come form it.</p>
				<h3>Market Commons</h3>
				<p>Markdown is a good and easy­‑to­‑use markup language, but if youʼre writing documents with complex internal structure, or which have particular accessibility requirements, its limitations can overcome its strengths. <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/MarketCommons-Racket">Market Commons</a> is a quick­‑and­‑dirty markup language for writing HTML documents in fewer characters than HTML documents typically take. Itʼs implemented in, and requires, Racket, and may still have a few bugs here or there.</p>
				<p>The name is a reference to Common Market, a Seattle hip­‑hop group.</p>
				<h3>The Fediverse</h3>
				<p>One of the places where people express themselves a <em>lot</em> on the internet is social media. But the models of social media which we are working with today force the people who use them to conform to their developersʼ model of “what a user should look like” in order to make themselves heard. I think that decentralized social media has a lot of potential for breaking with this platform model, and have spent a great deal of time working to both develop and theorize it in the past. <a href="./Documents/fediguide.xhtml">Here, Iʼve collected a list of fediverse­‑related documents</a> that Iʼve written over the years.</p>
				<h3>Style: \u2764</h3>
				<p>I learned how to design webpages primarily from looking at the source code of various other peopleʼs amateur webpages. But the age of the amateur webpage is well behind us now. <a href="https://style.u2764.com/"><cite>Style: \u2764</cite></a> is a repository of some of the web designs that I have created over the years, to serve as a sort of reference material for what amateur web design might look like in 2020 and beyond.</p>

				<h2>Experimenting with language</h2>
				<h3>KIBI English</h3>
				<p>I love English—as a language, I love the English language—but the politics of it are fraught, to say the least. For much of its history, English has been at war with itself—governed by an upper­‑class which despised non­‑Latin letters, non­‑Latin spellings, non­‑Latin grammatical constructs (English is not a Latin language)—now, this aberrant form is being utilized as an agent of colonialism, English as whiteness par excellence, for similarly waging war against non­‑European cultures around the world.</p>
				<p>The only path I see for salvaging English from this toxic programme is to return to it some character other than the transparent whiteness which it has been forced to maintain. I see resituating English as <em>a</em> language of the world, rather than <em>the</em> world language, as a fundamental step in resituating English culture as <em>a</em>, and not <em>the</em>, culture of the globe.</p>
				<p>And I think one of the most radical places for asserting this difference is on the level of orthography. English is <em>so</em> strongly associated with Basic Latin—that is, ASCII—but our Basic Latin orthography is not particularly well­‑suited to English! What would it look like if English joined the other languages of the world in needing something a little more expressive than just plain ASCII?</p>

				<h2>Advancing the artform of literature</h2>
				<p>If I think the English language is in a rough spot, <strong>I think English literature is in even a worse one.</strong> This is the hardest point for me to talk about, because I donʼt actually have anything <em>done</em> yet (thatʼs a lie—Iʼve written <strong>a lot of fanfiction</strong>) but believe me when I say I spend long hours thinking about it.</p>
				<h3><cite>Journal: \u2764</cite></h3>
				<p>If we expand the definition of <i>literature</i> to include “casual criticism”, I do keep a web­‑journal running over at <a href="https://www.u2764.com/"><cite>Journal: \u2764</cite></a>. The goal of this journal is to reïmagine internet publishing as a union of form and content, with each page standing on its own with a unique design and character. Itʼs also something of a storage space for my thoughts that is a little more permanent that what one might find on social media.</p>

				<h2>Getting in touch</h2>
				<p>If you want to contact me, <strong>the best place to do so is on the fediverse</strong>, where I have two accounts: <a href="https://monsterpit.net/@kibimon">@kibimon<wbr/>@monsterpit<wbr/>.net</a>, which is where I put my more <strong>critical or tech­‑oriented thoughts</strong> (ignoring the fact that that server is otherwise brimming with lewd monsters—itʼs a Fediverse thing), and <a href="https://elekk.xyz/@jellyfish_link">@jellyfish_link<wbr/>@elekk<wbr/>.xyz</a>, which represents my more <strong>positive, literary, and passion­‑oriented side</strong>.</p>
				<p>Right now (February 2020) I am also attempting to write a letter a day, and you can read <a href="./Documents/icwm-2020.xhtml">an archive of those letters here</a>.</p>
				<p>My pronouns are <i>they</i>/<i>them</i>/<i>their</i>/<i>theirs</i>/<i>themself</i> (in formal/impersonal situations), <i>she</i>/<i>her</i>/<i>her</i>/<i>hers</i>/<i>herself</i> (when gender is relevant), and <i>hyo</i>/<i>hie</i>/<i>hie</i>/<i>hine</i>/<i>hieself</i> (when itʼs not).</p>
