_| i |_ { .S } would like to say it took ‚Äúan afternoon‚Äù to devise, but in fact it is the culmination of roughly a half¬≠‚Äëdecade of gradual development. _| t |_ { .S }his particular hand is an evolution of my small¬≠‚Äëcaps script (seen above ‚Üó), which i noticed slowly diverging from my majuscules over the past year (and perhaps helped on its way a bit). _| a |_ { .S }s followers of me on social media will note, i am not wont to use capital letters in my regular communication. _| s |_ { .S }o having a mixed¬≠‚Äëscript penmanship seemed a tad unnecessary, especially so far as such things as legibility are concerned.

*| #| l |# { .DROP }ast night i dreamt of college. |* _| n |_ { .S }ot such a strange occurance, but what made this dream interesting was that it actually seemed... happy?! _| b |_ { .S }ecause college was not generally a very happy time for me. _| b |_ { .S }ut i think there is a part of me which misses having an apartment and living with friends.

_| i |_ { .S }t is a difficult thing for me to reason about, because in many ways i feel i am happier, healthier, and more stable as i am now. _| b |_ { .S }ut in other ways, it feels as though the feet have been taken out from under me.

$$$$

#| i |# { .DROP }¬†also spent a good deal of time‚Äîtoo much, really‚Äîthinking about english orthography‚Äîwhich is to say my respelling rules feel very firm by now, and i am just waiting on my codex software (]| w.i.p. |] { /work /in /progress }) such that i have a place to document it. _| i |_ { .S } despise like 90% of the people who speak in runes, but i even had a look at the anglo¬≠‚Äësaxon fu√æorc, and it turns out that an anglo¬≠‚Äësaxon alphabet is quite suited to english (who would have thought?), so the case may be that i am unwittingly inventing a runic transliteration system as well. _| t |_ { .S }he major question is diacritics!

$$$$

#| th |# { .DROP }ere are actually a great many projects which i am itching to write codices/encyclop√¶dias/handbooks/primers/etc. for, which is why i have been working so hard on programming of late! _| w |_ { .S }riting tests has been exhausting. _| b |_ { .S }ut i‚Äôm excited with where it is heading.

#| th |# { .DROP }is letter comes to you a little late‚Äîi spent last night working hard on refactoring my _| Resource |_ { .NAME } code to make use of @| _| ECMAScript Proxy Objects |_ { .NAME } |@ { !https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-proxy-objects }‚Äîso that the triple ~| <example:1> rdfs:label "Example". |~ can be written plainly as

` <pre><code>const resource = new Resource ("example:1")
` resource[pname`rdfs:label`] = "Example"</code></pre>

which needless to say was a lot of work for a primarily aesthetic improvement‚Äîand i still haven‚Äôt written the tests yet.

_| m |_ { .S }y initial hope for this project was to try to keep the whole library under 65,536 characters, but considering i am presently at 61,020, that is looking increasingly unlikely. _| b |_ { .S }ut surely 1,114,112 is still a reasonable upper bound! :P. _| t |_ { .S }he length comes from my insistence on doing everything in a single file‚Äîso that includes basic data structures, more advanced graph/resource operations, @| _| N‚ÄëTriples |_ { .NAME } |@ { !https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/ } and @| _| Turtle |_ { .NAME } |@ { !https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/ } ]| i/o |] { /Input/Output }, _| ]| HMTL |] |_ { .NAME } and native _| JavaScript |_ { .NAME } output, and of course the actual codex software itself.

#| y‚Äô |# { .DROP }all remember that one article that was like @| '| Kanye‚Äôs Politics Are What Happens When You Don‚Äôt Read Books |' { .SMALL } |@ { !https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/kanyes-politics-are-what-happens-when-you-dont-read-boo-1825475113 }? _| h |_ { .S }ere, i‚Äôll just quote a bit at you: "| Kanye has a humongous platform, though, and is used to people listening to what he has to say. And that might make him believe that what he has to say is worth listening to‚Äî |"and wow, hello mastodon!

_| h |_ { .S }ere‚Äôs the thing. _| w |_ { .S }hen it comes to knowing if your takes are worthwhile, you can‚Äôt learn that if you only listen to yourself. _| y |_ { .S }ou can‚Äôt learn that from your followers, either. _| y |_ { .S }ou gotta actually like... broaden your horizons a bit... and, like, read a book.

_| t |_ { .S }he word ‚Äúread‚Äù here is flexible but the word ‚Äúbook‚Äù isn‚Äôt. _| i |_ { .S } mean, you can listen to an audiobook. _| b |_ { .S }ut the thing about a book is it‚Äôs actually, y‚Äôknow, *| edited |*, and not the off¬≠‚Äëthe¬≠‚Äëcuff sort of friendchat that fills social media and‚Äîyes‚Äîpodcasts. _| f |_ { .S }riendchat is important‚Äîconversation is where synthesis happens‚Äîbut friendchat cannot check you when you‚Äôre talking out your ass. _| y |_ { .S }ou gotta read a book.

$$$$

#| wh |# { .DROP }en i first joined mastodon, something i immediately missed from my time on twitter was the journalism. _| p |_ { .S }eople on twitter share articles all the time, and articles are like books, but shorter. _| i |_ was okay with this in the first months after i joined, because i joined in 2016 and _| Donald Trump |_ { .NAME } had just been elected president. _| b |_ { .S }ut it‚Äôs been, like, three years, and there‚Äôs still the same takes and lack of substance. _| i |_ { .S } tried to make it happen with my own shit‚Äîi offered to edit a zine and wrote all kinds of articles‚Äîno luck. _| f |_ { .S }edis don‚Äôt wanna read, they wanna shitpost and spicy take all over the timeline. _| i |_ { .S }dk fam, is that really how you plan on defeating capitalism?!

#| f |# { .DROP }olks who were around on mastodon in 2017 might remember what was described as the magic of that time. _| t |_ { .S }hink my @| _| CYBREMONDAY |_ { .NAME } |@ { !https://go.kibi.family/CYBREMONDAY/2018/ } (2018) zine; there were folks trying to figure out how to hack the blockchiain to give trans girls money; there were folks joining up to make music, podcasts, games; @| Mutant Standard |@ { !https://mutant.tech/ } got started around that time, as did @| GlitchSoc |@ { !https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/ }, which i was involved in. _| f |_ { .S }or a long time i thought that magic was driven by a lie, which collapsed sometime mid¬≠‚Äë2018, but with the stuff going on about @| _| #MastoMonday |_ { .NAME } |@ { !https://elekk.xyz/tags/MastoMonday } lately i‚Äôm beginning to wonder if maybe that magic is still alive. _| m |_ { .S }aybe what‚Äôs changed... is my relation to it.

#| a |# { .DROP }nd not just mine‚Äîcodemom left; persons who shall not be named (thankfully, in some cases) stepped out of the public spotlight. _| b |_ { .S }ut as an early adopter of mastodon, connectedness to its dominant culture and trends for me largely came free. _| a |_ { .S }nd it‚Äôs been a weird‚Äîand perhaps difficult‚Äîtransition out of that place to where i am now. _| t |_ { .S }o be clear: _| i |_ { .S } was tired as fuck of having hundreds of followers, and intentionally distanced myself from the popular folks who attracted them. _| i |_ { .S }‚Äôm not complaining about being obscure. _| b |_ { .S }ut that doesn‚Äôt mean i don‚Äôt still have dreams; it doesn‚Äôt mean i don‚Äôt still want to organize and get things done. _| w |_ { .S }e need a social media where the little people can accomplish things, too.

#| i |# { .DROP } actually did update @| my webpage |@ { !https://go.KIBI.family/ }! _| i |_ { .S }t looks all clean and professional now. _| i |_t actually took me somewhat by surprise, seeing how many things i had listed on it, because in the past it has always seemed a struggle finding anything to list at all. _| i |_ { .S } guess i have been busy? _| a |_ { .S }nd that‚Äôs not even counting the fact that i, like, did a _| NaNoWriMo |_ { .NAME } last year.

_| i |_ { .S } still feel like most of my work over the past few years has been primarily not useful to anyone but myself. _| i |_ think doing things which are helpful to other people might be my 2020 goal.

#| th |# { .DROP }ere‚Äôs a phrase: _| t |_ { .S }he best camera for capturing a moment is the one you have with you? _| i |_ feel like i don‚Äôt hear that phrase enough. _| t |_ { .S }he best publishing platform is the one you have access to. _| t |_ { .S }he best chat app is the one your friends have installed. _| t |_ { .S }he best digital audio workstation is the one which runs on your computer. _| i |_ { .S } think sometimes we get so caught up in obtaining the proper equipment that we forget to capture the moment using the equipment we have. _| d |_ { .S }on‚Äôt run home for your ]| DSLR |] { /Digital /Single¬≠‚Äëlens /Reflex /Camera }, pull out your phone and take a picture of the damn sunset. _| y |_ { .S }‚Äôknow?

_| i |_ { .S } think probably the biggest change in my approach over the past few years has been in designing cameras you can capture the sunset with.
